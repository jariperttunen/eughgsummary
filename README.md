# Create GHG summaries for selected countries from CRF Reporting tables.

To alleviate examination and comparison of GHG net emissions in reporting countries
eughgsummary contains three scripts to collect and organise data from annual CRF Reporting tables
(i.e. "official excel files") as country by country and year by year excel files and sheets. 

Currently it is possible to gather data concerning LULUCF land use categories,
harvested wood products and LULUCF summmary. The levels used are the one that are
common to all parties. The collected data is provided as is, no further analysis or examination is done.
